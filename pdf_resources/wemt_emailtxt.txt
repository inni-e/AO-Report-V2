Good evening parents,

Please find attached your child's individualised report which contains information about your child's raw marks, question types & rankings. At the end of the report there are worked solutions for that exam paper.

If you have not received it already, within the next few hours, we will send out separate reports with your child's responses to each question from the term test. This will come from the email address: noreply@evalbee.com

To review the questions from the term test, please access a recording of the explanations via this link: https://youtu.be/tPtxeCGt9u0

If you have any queries about how to interpret the report, please contact your respective branch.

Kind regards,
Alpha One Team
