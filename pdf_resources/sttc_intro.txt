Good evening parents,
Please find attached your child's individualised report which contains information about your child's raw marks, rankings & overall placement score estimate. At the end of the report there are worked solutions as well as a writing exemplar for that exam paper.

Please keep in mind that these trial test exams are quite challenging as they are written to the same level of difficulty as the real selective test. The level of difficulty of the trial tests will be roughly the same throughout the program so that parents will be able to track the child's progress over the terms.

If you have any queries, please let your branch manager know!

Kind regards,
Alpha One Team
